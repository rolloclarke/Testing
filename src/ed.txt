.1. The Box

[There is an old cardboard box centre stage, lit as the audience enter.]

[Librarians enter in darkness wearing balaclavas.]

OSWALD:
We're not terrorists, we're librarians.

LYNDSEY:
We're not meant to be here.

OSWALD:
This library was closed down last week.

ZACH:
We've been made redundant. Apparently there is no need for librarians anymore. 

OSWALD:
The government says we can't afford to keep pointless old books.

ZACH:
And Kay Burley said on Sky News that libraries were only visited by weirdos, freaks and the mentally ill. And that everything was on the internet now anyway.

LYNDSEY:
Kay Burley never actually said that.

ZACH:
But it sounds like the kind of thing she would say.

OSWALD:
I hate that woman.

ZACH:
So that's why they have closed the libraries - this library. They are turning it into a Costa Coffee.

LYNDSEY:
It's just Costa.

OSWALD:
The books have been left ready for the incinerator.

NAOMI:
But we're still here. We've broken back in.

[They all look towards the door as if they've heard a noise off stage.]

ZACH:
It's ok. I've locked the doors and disabled the alarm.

OSWALD:
But the police could be on their way.

LYNDSEY:
Don't worry, we don't intend to hurt anyone, we won't take any hostages.

NAOMI:
We've come back for this box.

[They look at the box]

OSWALD:
Inside are photos dating back to 1948.

ZACH:
There are home videos, interviews, cassettes

NAOMI:
Letters, notes, diary accounts

LYNDSEY:
Newspaper articles, books,

NAOMI:
Medical records, music and poetry

OSWALD:
Including this crumpled poem - it's been folded so many times, you can hardly read it.

NAOMI:
The box belonged to a lady called Rose.

LYNDSEY:
We knew her. She used to come here every day.

ZACH:
When we first met Rose we thought she was mad. Plenty of strange people do come here.

NAOMI:
But actually Rose wasn't mad.

OSWALD:
Well, no more than any of us.

ZACH:
She would sit for hours reading and researching.

LYNDSEY:
She was a detective, a sleuth, she was investigating a mystery.

OSWALD:
And the story she uncovered - it might just save this library.

NAOMI:
But let's not get ahead of ourselves, we need to go through it piece by piece.

OSWALD:
Her story has gaps in it, and lots of emptiness in-between the gaps,

ZACH:
So quite often we'll have to use our imagination.

OSWALD:
But we think it's important. It's why we came back.

NAOMI:
Let's begin when Rose met Sebastian - it's where she'd want us to start.

ZACH:
Every good mystery has a love story, and this one is no exception.

LYNDSEY:
We don't know exactly where or when Rose and Sebastian met, but we do know that they were both in their early 40's and living in Canada.

[ZACH passes LYNDSEY a small box of letters taken from the big box]

We think that this is the first letter they exchanged. It is from Sebastian dated 6th June 1978. Inside the envelope was a cassette with a song on it, we think the song was important.

ZACH:
They could have met in a bar.

[OSWALD becomes SEBASTIAN, and NAOMI plays ROSE]

SEBASTIAN:
Hi, do you come here often?

ZACH:
They could have met in the park.

SEBASTIAN:
Hi, fancy feeding the ducks?

LYNDSEY:
Or maybe, just maybe, they could have met somewhere a bit different. On a bridge. Very late at night. In the rain.

.2. Tree of Forgetting One

[ROSE stands downstage looking out. SEBASTIAN is listening to Victor Jara through headphones]

[SEBASTIAN removes headphones]

SEBASTIAN:
Are you OK?

ROSE:
Yes I'm fine.

SEBASTIAN:
You look like you've been crying.

ROSE:
It's the rain in my eyes, that's all.

SEBASTIAN:
You're not going to throw yourself off?

ROSE:
No

SEBASTIAN:
It's beautiful.

ROSE:
What?

SEBASTIAN:
This. It's beautiful here.

[Rose looks out]

SEBASTIAN:
You've come here to escape?

ROSE:
Something like that.

SEBASTIAN:
Me too.

ROSE:
What are you escaping?

SEBASTIAN:
My past. Memories.

ROSE:
Is it working?

SEBASTIAN:
No. [Laughs]

SEBASTIAN:
What / about you ...

ROSE:
What are you listening to?

SEBASTIAN:
A song about forgetting.

ROSE:
Seriously?

SEBASTIAN:
Yeah. Promise. It's by Victor Jara, a Chilean folk singer, I'm from Chile. Here [SEBASTIAN passes headphones to ROSE]. Do you speak Spanish?

ROSE:
No.

SEBASTIAN:
I'll tell you what it says.

[ROSE puts headphones on. We hear the song at full volume.]

There is a man, and he says, "In my village there is a tree, which they call the tree of forgetting. Where they go to console themselves, those whose souls are dying, those whose souls are dead. In order to not think of you under the tree of forgetting, I went to sleep one evening, Vida Lita. And I fell into a deep sleep, I had a good sleep. On waking up from a dream I was thinking of you, I was still thinking of you; because I had forgotten how to forget you, the very moment I fell asleep."

Beautiful isn't it?

ROSE:
[Removing headphones and giving them back to SEBASTIAN] It's depressing.

SEBASTIAN:
I don't mind a bit of depressing sometimes.

ROSE:
Me neither. But stop saying that everything is beautiful. And don't tell me there is beauty in suffering.

SEBASTIAN:
There is. Proof's right here. You're beautiful and you're also clearly suffering. 

ROSE:
Wow. [Laughs] Did you really say that?

SEBASTIAN:
You're even more beautiful when you smile.

ROSE:
I haven't done that for a while.

SEBASTIAN:
You should do it more.

ROSE:
Maybe I will.

.3. Tree of Forgetting Two

ZACH:
So romantic.

LYNDSEY:
[Still holding letters] Over the following months Rose and Sebastian wrote hundreds of letters to each other, we have them here.

ZACH:
*SO* romantic.

LYNDSEY:
We'll skip forward to this letter, dated-

[LYNDSEY passes SEBASTIAN the first letter] 

SEBASTIAN [reading letter]:
4th February 1979. My Dear Rose,
Thank you for another lovely evening, and for putting up with my ramblings ... I've copied out a poem by Victor Jara seeing as you liked the song so much – it has been very important in my life. I would like you to read it. Let me know what you think.

LYNDSEY:
The letter then talks about an argument Sebastian had with his landlord

SEBASTIAN:
My shower has started leaking again so I phoned my landlord and he said a washer is broken inside the hose, which-

ZACH:
We won't bore you with now. 

LYNDSEY:
[Passing letter to ROSE] Rose then replied on 

ROSE:
6th February. Dear Sebastian, [scans through...]

Thank you for the poem - although I don't understand all of it – what does it mean? Why is it so important to you? I'm looking forward to seeing you this weekend. And don't worry about your landlord, he sounds like a-

ZACH:
Sebastian doesn't answer her question about the poem, not yet anyway.

LYNDSEY:
Their letters become more inquisitive, more personal, [while passing letters to SEBASTIAN] and then in the post script to a letter written in June, Sebastian asks:

SEBASTIAN:
Why have you never told me what it is you were trying to escape, the night we met?

ZACH:
Then nothing. No reply. A gap. But a month later, come two sentences, no pleasantries, just:

[LYNDSEY passes ROSE another letter]
  
ROSE:
It's not something I talk about to other people. I can't.

[SEBASTIAN reads from his next letter]
	
SEBASTIAN:
I understand – sorry, I didn't mean to make you feel uncomfortable. I suppose I've learnt, from my own past, that talking, remembering, can be helpful ... I would like to tell you, about what happened to me, before I came here ...

ROSE:
Ok.

SEBASTIAN:
Do you remember the poem I sent you?

[ROSE nods]

SEBASTIAN:
It was originally a manifesto. Victor – Victor Jara, sang it to thousands of prisoners inside the Estadio Chile.

[ZACH picks out a book about Chile from the box, as he flicks through it we see photos from the book projected on the screen.]

LYNDSEY:
Sebastian is referring to the military coup in Chile on September 11th 1973, when he was 37. The socialist government of President Allende was violently overthrown by General Pinochet. The football stadium, the Estadio Chile, became a sort of prison.

SEBASTIAN:
The prisoners memorised the music and wrote down the words on scraps of paper. It is one of the most important things ever written. So important someone risked their life to smuggle the poem out in their shoe.

ROSE:
Who was it? Why would anyone risk their life for a poem?

SEBASTIAN:
Victor Jara's poem meant everything. It was hope; it showed us that something good might come out of the horrors of the coup, that something might come out of his death.

ROSE:
How did he die?

SEBASTIAN:
It was brutal. Are you sure you want to hear? 

ROSE:
Yes.

SEBASTIAN:
They tortured him for days. He was blindfolded, chained, beaten and electrocuted. They broke his fingers so that he couldn't play the guitar and then they shot him 44 times.

ROSE:
How do you know?

SEBASTIAN:
Because I was there. I was in the stadium. 

ROSE:
You too?

SEBASTIAN:
Yes, all of us. They forced our heads into buckets of excrement, suffocated us with bags. They put electricity into people's eyes and mouths ... I can still see the faces of people shaking on the floor, crying like babies, calling for their mothers.

ROSE:
I don't understand, why would they do that?

SEBASTIAN:
I was a supporter of Allende. I tried burning all my books, anything that linked me to socialism, but it didn't matter. My neighbour denounced me. I was arrested in the middle of the night and taken to the Estadio Chile.

ROSE:
How did you get out?

SEBASTIAN:
After what felt like forever but must have been only about a week, I was released.

ROSE:
Why?

[Pause]

SEBASTIAN:
I don't know. Sometimes I wish I had died in that stadium – I felt like a traitor.

ROSE:
But weren't you happy to be set free?

SEBASTIAN:
Free to what? Whilst we were being tortured the country was in chaos and they took advantage. They implemented something called economic shock therapy.

ROSE:
Who did? Pinochet?

SEBASTIAN:
Yes. But the whole thing happened with the West's backing. He was following the advice of an American economist called Milton Friedman. The West was at war with socialism, and Friedman said they needed a crisis in order to win. So immediately after the coup, there was a huge transfer of wealth from public to private hands, they made lots of cuts to the state all at the same time. We were the casualties of economic freedom. They killed my friends and they tried to kill my dreams, and that is why Victor's poem is so important. When he says, 'what I see, I have never seen, what I felt and what I feel will give birth to the moment' he is saying that what happened to us in that stadium meant something, the story means something. You can never keep the people down forever, our time will come. Illegittimi non carborundum!

ROSE:
What?

SEBASTIAN:
It's latin for don't let the bastards grind you down.

[They both laugh]

SEBASTIAN:
I'm sorry for baring my soul, but telling people the whole story is important for me. I feel a bit better, thank you [he looks at her]. Whatever it is, if you want to, you can tell me, I'll listen.

ROSE:
I can't.

SEBASTIAN:
Ok.

ROSE:
I mean I can't. I can't remember. 

SEBASTIAN:
What?

ROSE:
I don't remember, my past, my life-
 
SEBASTIAN:
But you must be able to / remember something

ROSE:
I'm not making this up ... I wish I could remember, I want to but I can't. 

SEBASTIAN:
Sorry I wasn't trying to upset you, forgive me.

ROSE:
I want to remember. But-

SEBASTIAN:
Maybe I could try and help you.

.4. Tree of Forgetting Three

[LYNDSEY enters holding a video from the box and old photos. ZACH prepares the video camera and gives it to SEBASTIAN. The footage from the camera is projected live on to the back screen.]

LYNDSEY:
Sebastian was true to his word. He did help Rose. We have the video recordings to prove it.

[SEBASTIAN films as he looks through some old photos belonging to ROSE.]

SEBASTIAN:
Who's this?

ROSE:
That's me. Doing my best Marilyn Monroe.

SEBASTIAN:
You don't look very happy about it.

ROSE:
Stop it.

SEBASTIAN:
Who are you with here?

ROSE:
My sister.

SEBASTIAN:
You're on the left? [ROSE nods] You look about 16.

ROSE:
There's a date on the back of this one. 25th August 1950. Taken on my birthday.

SEBASTIAN:
Who's this?

ROSE:
I don't know.

SEBASTIAN:
Who's Allan?

ROSE:
What?

SEBASTIAN:
It says it on the back. No date.

ROSE:
No, that's *the* Allan. The hospital at the university I went to.

SEBASTIAN:
Is it near where you grew up?

ROSE:
Not too far.

SEBASTIAN:
Where was that?

ROSE:
Smiths Falls, a small town near Ottawa.

SEBASTIAN:
What about school?

ROSE:
I went to St Francis. Then McGill.

SEBASTIAN:
Good, so I want you to tell me about your earliest memory.

[SEBASTIAN now has the camera focussed on ROSE's face]

ROSE:
My earliest memory. I suppose it was my birthday. It was a sunny day, we were in the garden, and I can picture the flowers in the garden. And a cake that my mum had made, and the icing melted so it collapsed in the heat, and she was crying, and I felt like it was all my fault. My whole family was there, and I remember lying on the grass and looking up at the blue sky.

SEBASTIAN:
How old were you?

ROSE:
18?

SEBASTIAN:
18?

ROSE:
I told you, I've got the worst memory of anyone I know. 

SEBASTIAN:
Nothing from before then?

ROSE:
Not really, no.

SEBASTIAN:
So what about after that?

ROSE:
A few scraps, I definitely remember coming out of hospital because I stayed with my sister. I wasn't in a good place.

SEBASTIAN:
How old were you?

ROSE:
20.

SEBASTIAN:
Go on.

ROSE:
I was very different then to how I am now. I don't want to talk about it. 

SEBASTIAN:
Why not?

[Pause]

ROSE:
I had been in hospital for about three months, and I remember them telling me I was going home one day. But I couldn't go home to my parents.

SEBASTIAN:
Why?

ROSE:
They wouldn't have me. Said they couldn't cope. So I had to stay with my sister Anna. Ruth had been born, my niece. I think that she was almost one. I spent most of my time in the single room at the end of the corridor. Now, the rest may be a memory, or it might be my imagination.

SEBASTIAN:
What do you mean?

ROSE:
I've heard about what happened so many times from my family / so I-

SEBASTIAN:
Why?

ROSE:
It was their reason for cutting off contact. The story goes that I was appallingly behaved, that I was a disgrace to the family, that I was malicious and disgusting.

SEBASTIAN:
What happened?

[Beat]

ROSE:
I wasn't well at all, everyone knew it, but the doctors discharged me anyway. Apparently I lay in bed for almost a month. And then after that, I remember wandering around the house when there was no one in - it was a big, empty feeling house. It feels like I was there forever, but apparently it was only a few months. Once, they found me in the living room in the middle of the night, there was a big damp patch on the new carpet and I had soiled myself; I was crying, sucking my thumb and asking to be bottle-fed. I remember my sister screaming 'YOU ARE NOT A BABY', and me screaming back, and us both just screaming and screaming. That night they took me back to the hospital and left me in the reception.

SEBASTIAN:
Really?

ROSE:
Yes. Although I only know that because my sister told me in a letter when she said she didn't want any more to do with me. I've never told anyone that.

SEBASTIAN:
What is the last thing you remember that you know is true?

ROSE:
Meeting you. Although I don't know if that's just because you're still here, so it must be true.

SEBASTIAN:
But what is it you are trying to forget? 

ROSE:
Nothing. I was just unwell.

SEBASTIAN:
I'm sure something happened to you. 

ROSE:
Why?

SEBASTIAN:
When people have been through trauma of some kind, they can lose their memory. I have friends from home who can't remember parts of their pasts.

ROSE:
I don't know-

SEBASTIAN:
Maybe something happened when you were young? Or in hospital, I don't know. 

ROSE:
So neither of us know anything then.

SEBASTIAN:
For now, but there must have been something / or why

ROSE:
I'm tired, can we-

SEBASTIAN:
Yes of course. I'm sorry.

[The camera stops]

.5. Electric Dreams

LYNDSEY:
Who is this woman without a history? Why is Rose a blank slate?

ZACH:
Despite all this uncertainty, Sebastian's faith in Rose was enduring; his commitment to this woman who seemingly knew nothing of herself continued.

LYNDSEY:
But Sebastian had opened the floodgates.

ZACH:
Her electric dreams began. [Music starts] Memories and ideas came spilling out of her. Layer upon layer. Slowly at first/

LYNDSEY:
/Then faster and faster

ROSE:
The Allan. McGill University. Librarians give her the journal and pen.

LYNDSEY:
She started writing, at first in a journal, and then wherever she could - on scraps of paper, envelopes, receipts and sometimes even on dollar bills. Bits of paper fall out of the journal

ROSE:
There were people looking at me, standing over me...why were they looking at me... Lyndsey hands her an envelop and she writes "people looking down at me, staring, staring/ staring, staring at me"

ZACH:
Zach lights her with a builders light as he speaks The more she unravelled the more she tried to put herself together.

ROSE:
[New realisation] "Time, time" [LYNDSEY gives her the fag packet]

I didn't know what time it was... breakfast for dinner, dinner for breakfast, breakfast for dinner.

[New realisation, LYNDSEY gives her paper] Echoes, footsteps getting closer, coming down the corridor, echoes, go away.

[New realisation, LYNDSEY gives her a dollar bill] Something pressing down on me, holding me down, I can't breathe.

[New realisation, ZACH puts down the light, and gives her paper] Blood in my mouth.

[Rose goes to pick up the builders light and gets a shock, she pulls down the sheet at the back and looks at the writing on the wall]

Stinging in my arms, stinging in my arms, tension all over my... [looking up] white ceilings, white curtains, white woman, a woman in white, The Allan, welcome to The Allan, you are a calm confident woman, you are a calm, confident woman, you are a calm confident women..." The floor is covered in writing saying "You are a calm confident woman and people enjoy your company"

.6. That Was Me

LYNDSEY:
Then suddenly

ZACH:
All the scribblings stop.

LYNDSEY:
Because she got an answer.

ZACH:
We have this newspaper cutting from the 19th November 1992. The headline 'Brainwashed Canadians Sue CIA'.

LYNDSEY:
We don't know where Rose was when she saw it. She could have been at home

ZACH:
She might have heard the report on the radio.

LYNDSEY:
She might have seen the paper on a news stand in the street

ZACH:
Or Sebastian might have brought it home to her.

SEBASTIAN:
Rose, I think you need to listen to this.

ZACH:
But we know that Rose read the article and must have immediately appreciated its significance.

SEBASTIAN [reading newspaper]:
"Linda Macdonald, 55, said she was drugged, kept asleep for 86 days and given more than 100 electroshocks and subjected to "psychic driving" to wipe her brain clear. Released after five months, she did not remember her husband, children or the first 26 years of her life."

She couldn't remember the first 26 years of her life. She couldn't remember the first 26 years of her life. That's you Rose.

"She could no longer read or write, cook a meal, make a bed and had to be toilet trained."

ROSE:
Baby talk. Memory loss.

SEBASTIAN:
"An institute at McGill University in Montreal, headed by Dr. Ewen Cameron, was one of the centres where such experiments were carried out."

ROSE:
McGill University. I went to McGill University. "Patients went to see Dr. Cameron voluntarily and didn't realise until much later that they were being used in experiments." I can see myself walking into a room and asking for help. He said he would help me.

LYNDSEY:
Rose wrote to McGill University asking for a copy of her medical file. It took three months for her to receive a reply.

OSWALD:
In the meantime, she read voraciously, about Ewen Cameron, his ideas and the experiments he had run at McGill. Listen carefully, these ideas are very important. Influential. They will go well beyond Rosee.

.7. The Eminent Monster

CAMERON:
As a psychiatrist it's my job to liberate people from mental illness. My life's struggle has been to ask how?

For years we have asked what caused mental illness? We've tried every talking therapy in the book. I was tired of not being able to help my patients, tired of letting them down, tired of telling them I hadn't yet found an answer or a cure. But now I have the answer. The cure. We don't need to find the cause of the illness in the brain. With my new research, we can regress the mind back to the time before the damage was done. We can wipe the brain clean. I call this "de-patterning".

Now this isn't easy, it's not like you just swallow a pill. We achieve this by attacking the brain with everything known to disrupt its normal functioning - prolonged sleep, disorientating drugs and electric shocks. This might sound bad, but really it's good.

We have to regress the patient to a child-like state, before they learned their unhealthy patterns of thinking. We return them to infant innocence. Finally, on this blank slate, we can then re-programme the mind with healthy new messages to make the patient function better. I call this "psychic driving".

I play my patients simple tape-recorded messages, over and over again. For example, 'You are a good mother and wife and people enjoy your company'. When my patients absorb these new messages, they start behaving differently. No longer do I try to mend or repair my patients. I re-create them anew. We can start over again. My patients now make a rapid transition to become a new person.

This research will revolutionise the way we treat the mentally ill, it will have far reaching impacts for the well-being of people all over the world.

.8. Rose Meets the Doctor

OSWALD:
Rose got her medical file. We have it here. 138 pages. Don't worry we won't read it all. We don't need to. Rose highlighted the important bits. She did the work for us.

LYNDSEY:
We start with Dr Cameron's notes from his first few meetings with Rose when he diagnosed her. She was 18 years old.

[Flash. Sound.]

CAMERON:
Hello. Pleased to meet you. My name is Dr Cameron, and you must be Rose.

OSWALD:
At times they are scant and sometimes illegible

[Flash. Sound.]

CAMERON:
Hello Rose, take a seat. One moment and I will be right with you.

OSWALD:
All we know for sure is the outcome... though this actually happened over several meetings.

[Flash. Sound.]

CAMERON:
Hello Rose. So, Dr Clarke passed your file onto me. Do you know why?

ROSE:
Sometimes I get a bit panicky, I don't know what to do about it, my parents thought you might be able to help me?

CAMERON:
I'm sure I can. Can you try and describe how your nervousness feels?

ROSE:
It feels like it's hard to breathe, like I need to escape ... often I wake up feeling scared, so I don't really sleep very well and sometimes find it hard to concentrate, my mother says I will never find a husband who will put up with me ...

CAMERON:
I am sure that is not true. Now is there anything on your mind that might be causing the current nervousness?

ROSE:
Well it was my birthday recently and, well, it was quite stressful.

CAMERON:
Why was your birthday stressful?

ROSE:
Um, I don't know, it's just my father can be difficult sometimes, and he had organised a big family party when I said I didn't want one and-

CAMERON:
You don't want your family around you?

ROSE:
No, it's just that-

CAMERON:
You said you father was difficult, are you scared of him?

ROSE:
I didn't say that.

CAMERON:
You did Rose.

ROSE:
But that's not what I meant.

CAMERON:
Then why did you say it? You just said 'My father can be difficult.' That's what you said.

[Flash. Sound.]

CAMERON:
Can we return to your father? Tell me more about him.

ROSE:
Um, he gets angry a lot, he has a fierce temper. My mother can get quite upset... I don't know, I think I often feel like it's my fault, which is probably silly-

CAMERON:
Does he get violent?

ROSE:
...No.

CAMERON:
Has he ever hit you?

ROSE:
No.

CAMERON:
I need you to be honest...

ROSE:
My nervousness is nothing to do with him, I just get a bit panicky, I have done for a few years. It really isn't a big deal/

CAMERON:
/I wish it were as simple as that. I see a lot of young women like you. It starts just like this, a little nervousness, nothing to worry about and then, well often it gets much worse. I have patients who were like you, and they left it too late. Now they hear voices, see things, they can't look after themselves.

ROSE:
Really? Do they really start like me?

CAMERON:
I'm afraid they do start like you Rose, and I am sure many of them wish they had got help earlier. You want to get better, I know you do.

ROSE:
Yes, I just want to be normal. Well...

CAMERON:
Forgive me, this can all be a little confusing can't it? Lets take it slowly.

[Flash. Sound.]

CAMERON:
I've been looking through our notes, and I will need you to stay with us for a few weeks.

ROSE:
Is that totally necessary? It's just I have exams coming up and-

CAMERON:
Rose, you need to commit to getting better. You'll be here for a couple of weeks and then you'll be free to go and live a happy and healthy life.

ROSE:
What is it you will actually be doing?

CAMERON:
Let me explain the treatment. It is like we are rubbing all the bad thoughts off a black board and replacing them with good thoughts. You see, normal people have normal reactions in their brains. But your brain isn't working at optimum level right now, there is a loose connection, so we need to rewire you. Just like a kitchen appliance, or a ford motor car, to make you run smoothly. We use a range of treatments and we'll put you into a deep sleep. We can start right now if you like?

ROSE:
Can I think about it?

CAMERON:
I only want to make you better, that is what you want isn't it?

ROSE:
Yes.

[Flash. Sound.]

ROSE:
I didn't know what to bring

CAMERON:
Oh you won't need very much, we will take good care of you here.

ROSE:
I brought a blanket I had when I was a little girl, that's silly isn't it?

CAMERON:
No that's perfect, you need to feel comfortable.

ROSE:
Yes. Ok.

CAMERON:
Well done Rose. Welcome to the Allan.

.9. The Sleep Room

OSWALD:
Rose's initial diagnosis as written in the file -

CAMERON:
'Suffering anxiety caused by an abusive father, an intensely disturbing man who made repeated psychological assaults on his daughter. Otherwise Rose is a hitherto well-balanced individual, excelling academically.'

LYNDSEY:
When she left the Allan Memorial institute her diagnosis was -

CAMERON:
Schizophrenic with marked hysterical features.

[Rose prepared for treatment, dressed in hospital gown, historical footage projected, tape plays...]

CAMERON [on audio of video]:	
Day 1. Rose admitted to hospital. Initial introduction with Dr Cameron. Restful nights sleep. Insulin administered inducing coma. Temperature 37.5, normal. Blood pressure normal. Breathing slightly rapid. No cause for concern. Cheerful, amenable, sociable and neat.

Temperature rises to 39. Wet shock observed with convulsions. Change in personality. Irritable, depressed and confused.

Glucose administered intravenously. Awakes disorientated and confused.

LSD administered. Initial euphoric phase followed by screaming and signs of hallucination. Violently scratches face causing excessive bleeding and pulls out large clumps of hair. Sedated.

Expressing bizarre ideas and disturbing behaviour. Threatens medical staff.

.10. Outwards and Outwards and Outwards

	[Sebastian helps Rose get up from the floor.]

ROSE:
Are you ok?

SEBASTIAN:
I feel responsible. Maybe it was better not knowing. If I'd have known where this was going to lead then ...

ROSE:
Sebastian, you have helped me find out about myself, you have helped me reclaim my memory, you will never know how much that means to me. But just knowing what happened isn't enough. I need to understand. I need to know why.

SEBASTIAN:
Be careful.

ROSE:
I'm going to write to Linda from the newspaper article.

SEBASTIAN:
She might not want to be contacted.

ROSE:
I know. But I have to do this.

SEBASTIAN:
This is beginning to consume you – I know how you feel I do, but, you need to find peace.

ROSE:
I have to.

SEBASTIAN:
I'm going to have a lie down. You know, sometimes I envy you, sometimes I wish I could have had my memory wiped, for me, remembering is the hardest thing.

[SEBASTIAN leaves and leaves suicide note behind]

LINDA [on voiceover]:
Dear Rose. Thank you for writing. I am always happy and sad when someone else contacts me from McGill. I am so glad that my story has helped you. Tens of people have written to me since the article. I started talking to another survivor, Alec, sometimes he spouts on about silly uplifting religious crap, but if you ignore that he is a nice enough fellow. And has some interesting things to say. I have included his number.

SURVIVOR 3 VOICEMAIL:
Hi Rose. I'm sorry I missed your call, it seems like we are destined never to speak.

It was nice of Linda to give you my number. Did she seem ok? I sometimes worry she drinks too much. Anywho, it's hard to know what to say in a message. But it's like I said in the trial; I can only say, they took an already abused 7 year old child and compounded my suffering beyond belief. The saddest part is - I know for a fact that I was not alone. If you're really interested in going deeper into this, you should speak to Bob, he's much better than me on all that stuff. In answer to your other question, I think I have found peace now. Although others haven't been so lucky.

[SURVIVOR 4 enters and sits next to ROSE]

ROSE:
Alec gave me your details.

SURVIVOR 3 VOICEMAIL:
Anyway, feel free to call me anytime. Remember, Jesus loves you Rose.

SURVIVOR 4:
They had convinced themselves that what was bad was good. That in doing terrible things to me and many others, including children, that they were helping, saving others. But it isn't true. Their thinking was upside down.

ROSE:
What do you mean?

SURVIVOR 4:
When Cameron started out he did want to help people like you and me. But he had an ego, he wanted success. He talked about wiping the brain clean and reprogramming it. The CIA caught wind. I know, it sounds likes something straight out the Manchurian Candidate. They pumped money into his research via various organisations.

[PSYCHIATRIST enters and sits next to ROSE]

PSYCHIATRIST:
Can we just be clear, I'm not seeing you as a doctor, this is not a consultation. It is hard for me to comment without seeing your file. I don't know the specifics. Certainly nothing can excuse what you had to suffer. I know Cameron was considered to be at the top of his profession at the time, but those were very different times.

ROSE:
I still don't understand how he was allowed to do this.

SURVIVOR 4:
It's complicated.

PSYCHIATRIST:
I'm afraid it wasn't just him. For a long time psychiatrists had no idea how to conceptualise or treat mental illnesses - cases were truly desperate, with patients severely unwell, often for the whole of their adult lives. Seeing their patients desperation made the doctors desperate too - desperate to find something, anything, which might improve lives. Some doctors became mavericks, pushing the boundaries to find cures.

PSYCHIATRIST:
He wouldn't get away with it now.

PSYCHIATRIST:
I think Cameron believed that he was helping people, that these treatments were punishing but progressive.

SURVIVOR 4:
But other people are getting away with it. His research has been used again.

ROSE:
What?

SURVIVOR 4:
The CIA got what they wanted. They took his work and have been using it for years, all over the world for purposes of "interrogation". State sanctioned torture.

PSYCHIATRIST:
It's very different today. Psychiatrists like me can make no apologies for the troubled past of our profession - we know that some of our history is confusing and dark - quite at odds with modern day practices. We try to keep our past in mind to ensure experiences like yours never happen again.

SURVIVOR 4:
They made a manual called Kubark. The similarities are striking.

ROSE:
Do you think that he knew he was being funded by the CIA?

SURVIVOR 4:
Yes.

PSYCHIATRIST:
I honestly don't know. I don't think it's ever been proven either way. Look, I've got to get back.

SURVIVOR 4:
I've gotta go. Check it out, It's on the net - Kubark.

PSYCHIATRIST:
Good Luck, Rose.

LINDA:
I'm doing ok.

PSYCHIATRIST:
Think about it.

LINDA:
I've been getting treatment for years. But my physical health isn't great. Sometimes I wish I was back there. It might sound mad, but I miss Dr Cameron. He believed I could get better. I want him to put his arm around me and tell me it's ok and give me an injection and put me to sleep.
I better get back to the crochet, it takes my mind off it, that and the vodka. / Yours Linda

.11. Sebastian Departs

ROSE:
/ Yours Linda. I'm thinking about going back there, to McGill.

[He looks at her]

I didn't choose to be, but I'm part of something bigger, this isn't just about me now. I have to go on...

SEBASTIAN:
Ok.

ROSE:
Will you come with me?

SEBASTIAN:
I'm tired.

[Pause]

ROSE:
Did you sleep last night?

SEBASTIAN:
Can I tell you something Rose? It might sound strange. Recently when I sleep, I keep going back to the Stadium. I keep hearing Jara's songs, (Song starts to play) seeing my friends. And I feel like I am floating above the stadium, and it is full of grass and the sky is blue and people are smiling, like they want me to go back, like they have forgiven me.

ROSE:
Forgiven you for what?

SEBASTIAN:
For surviving. I am going to go for a walk.

ROSE:
Shall I come with you?

SEBASTIAN:
No, you've got things to do. I love you Rose.

ROSE:
I love you too.

[Sebastian leaves the poem on a chair, puts his headphones on and leaves.]

ZACH:
Sebastian died on the 9th December 1998. We have the order of service from the funeral, and Rose's speech was folded inside. She read the poem by Victor Jara that Sebastian had sent her, all those years ago.

ROSE:
~How hard it is to sing
~When I must sing of horror
~Horror which I am living
~Horror which I am dying
~To see myself among so much and so many moments of infinity
~In which silence and screams are the end of my song
~What I see I have never seen
~What I have felt and what I feel
~Will give birth to the moment

ZACH:
You might think that that's where it stops. Rose had found out what happened to her, and maybe she just lived on grieving for her husband and grieving for her past. But that's not the end of Rose's story – it got bigger. A lot bigger

LYNDSEY:
After Sebastian died, her investigations continued, right here in this library.

OSWALD:
We don't know how she came to be here, but we will never forget when we first met Rose, it was about 6 months ago, the same day we found out the library was closing. Then she was just a strange old lady we had never seen before, but she quickly got our attention.

.12. Rose's Big Idea

[Sound of explosions. Video of Twin towers. ROSE is watching one screen, librarians are watching another.]

OSWALD:
Oh my god.

LYNDSEY:
What's going on?

OSWALD:
Look at this.

[They stare at the screen]

ROSE:
That's me

LYNDSEY:
Will it affect us?

ROSE:
That happened to me.

LYNDSEY:
They can't do that can they?

OSWALD:
They just have.

LYNDSEY:
I can't believe it. Bastards.

ZACH:
What's going on?

OSWALD:
They're going to cut funding to 4 libraries in the borough, including this one.

LYNDSEY:
What can we do?

OSWALD:
Nothing we can do about it now, we'll just have to wait.

ZACH:
What time is it? There's still someone on the computers.

OSWALD:
I'll go and tell her we're closing.

ROSE:
That's me. They did that to me.

OSWALD:
I beg your pardon.

ROSE:
That was me.

OSWALD:
Oh my God, why are you watching that?

ROSE:
That's what they did to me.

OSWALD:
Were you there?

ROSE:
No.

OSWALD:
Right. You know we're closing in 15 minutes, so you'll have to turn the computers off soon.

ROSE:
I need help.

LYNDSEY:
Yes. There are some leaflets at the front with numbers you can call.

ROSE:
No, with books. I'm researching.

OSWALD:
What are you researching?

ROSE:
My life.

LYNDSEY:
Ok, we can help you with that. Are you a member?

ROSE:
No. And World history.

LYNDSEY:
Right. Well we have lots of books in the history section, and we have an/ international

ROSE:
And The Iraq War. And Economics. And Torture. And 1970's Chile. And 9/11. And a University in Chicago. And South American Folk music.

OSWALD:
That's a lot. Why are you looking at all this?

ROSE:
I've been having my Electric Dreams again. I'm trying to work out what happens to people when they're in shock.

OSWALD:
Ha. We're in a state of shock today. We've just been told they want to close down the library.

LYNDSEY:
But that's not for a while. And we've still got 15 minutes left today, so where would you like to start?

ROSE:
I've been working on it for years.
She produces a box full of research

LYNDSEY:
That's great. Proactive!

OSWALD:
There's a lot in here already.

ROSE:
You'll have to catch up with all that, but first, get me everything on Shock and Awe.

OSWALD:
Now this is something we could do.

LYNDSEY:
A final project!

ZACH:
We got in books that had never been requested here before.

OSWALD:
We stretched our library's muscles.

ZACH:
She spent days, weeks reading. Coming in first thing, not leaving till we closed.

OSWALD:
Making notes upon notes.

ZACH:
Writing on anything that came to hand.

LYNDSEY:
And she would call out to us at the front desk:

ROSE:
I want to know where they attacked first.

LYNDSEY:
Or

ROSE:
What was the total number of dead in the first week of the war?

LYNDSEY:
Which was a little inappropriate in the middle of story time for under 5s.

ZACH:
We became experts. Sometimes we'd even stay after opening hours.

OSWALD:
At times the library was more like a mission control

ZACH:
Commanded by a little old lady, with an insatiable appetite for details.

LYNDSEY:
We would order in tens of books, hundreds of articles,

OSWALD:
And then one day we came upon this:

ROSE:
Shock and Awe: By Ullman and Wade

OSWALD:
It's an actual book, well, a pamphlet

ZACH:
We got it from the internet. Like a guidebook for the war.

LYNDSEY:
It was the military strategy.

ROSE:
Listen to this. Seize control of the environment... paralyse or so overload an adversary's perception and understanding of events... deprive the enemy of the ability to communicate... how did they do that?

ZACH:
It says here that on 28th March 2003, the Ministry of Communication was bombed, as were 4 Baghdad telephone exchanges, cutting off millions of phones. Television and radio transmitters were also hit, making it impossible for anyone to pick up even a weak signal.

ROSE:
This is shock.

ZACH:
Civilians bore the brunt - families weren't able to communicate across the city to see if their parents, or children were still alive.

OSWALD:
Electricity had been wiped out, there were no street lights. At night they were in total darkness.

ROSE:
Sensory Deprivation.

LYNDSEY:
Apart from the bombs.

ROSE:
Render the adversary impotent... achieve rapid dominance... what about the bombing?

LYNDSEY:
The scale of the bombing is well documented. There's loads of stuff on it.

OSWALD:
The whole city lit up.

LYNDSEY:
In the main 5 weeks of the bombing, the US dropped more than 30,000 bombs on Iraq, as well as 20,000 precision guided cruise missiles. Which is 67% of the total number that had ever been made.

ROSE:
Sensory Overload. What else?

ZACH:
Well obviously there was the torture and Abu Ghraib. There are hundreds of pictures that were taken inside the prison – apparently it was sanctioned as interrogation.

ROSE:
'The KUBARK manual offers a menu of options for confusing and weakening detainees.... Forced changes in diet and sleep patterns should make the subject disorientated.' Kubark. I've heard that word before. Yes. Do you have anything on the Kubark Manual?

ZACH:
I don't know if we do. Let me do a search.

LYNDSEY:
And then there was the looting. People ransacked the shops, the museums, the...

ZACH:
Kubark – how do you spell that?

ROSE:
K-U-B-A-R-K

ZACH:
We don't have it in stock. But I'll see if I can locate it.

LYNDSEY:
Listen to this "In the National Museum of Iraq hundreds of looters pillaged nothing less than records of the first human society... gone are 80% of the museums 170,000 priceless objects... the national library was a blackened ruin". It was like a lobotomy. The deep memory of an entire culture had been removed.

ROSE:
They created a blank slate.

LYNDSEY:
But that wasn't part of the military strategy.

ROSE:
This isn't just a military strategy.

OSWALD:
Within weeks of the invasion, Iraq was open for business, no tariffs, no duties, no inspections, no taxes. They made it the widest open market for American goods ever.

ROSE:
Yes! This was the re-programming.

OSWALD:
What are you talking about Rose?

ROSE:
Sensory deprivation, overload, excessive shocks, clean slate, that's what he tried to do to me.

[Dr. Cameron enters speaking in time to footage of Donald Rumsfeld. Throughout she becomes much more distressed.]

CAMERON:
But let me tell you about our aims and objectives for the days ahead.

We want to help you, to eliminate this disease, and make your life better, everyone here is focused on the task and we have several, specific objectives. Firstly, we want to end your illness by striking with force on a scope and scale that that will make sure your anxiety is finished. We have to identify, isolate and eventually eliminate the destructive parts of your brain; it's capability to produce destructive ideas that make you feel bad. It wont be easy, we will have to search for and drive out these negative thoughts that have found safe harbour in your brain. And all this - you, will help us research - you might be helping us to save other people, far beyond this Institute. We are collecting evidence - there are people all over the globe that we want to help. But first we want to help you, we want give you some relief, help you in your time of need. We are securing your future, it belongs to you. You need your sanity to create a life for yourself after years of anxiety and depression. So our techniques will provide you with the conditions to make a rapid transition to being able to look after yourself, you wont be a threat to anyone - you can be a calm, confident woman, and people will enjoy your company.

[Ends with a video overload of twin towers, troops, Bremmer, bombing, "you are a calm confident woman.]

OSWALD:
Rose. We have some bad news. We've got a date, for when the library is closing for good.

ROSE:
What?

OSWALD:
End of the week. The council have just announced it, it was on the radio.

LYNDSEY [furious]:
They didn't even tell us first.

ROSE:
Is it definite?

ZACH:
We've checked and yes, it is.

LYNDSEY:
We've been told not to discuss it with any customers.

OSWALD:
But we thought we should tell you, so that you can get yourself organised and collect your things together.

ROSE:
Can't you do something about it?

OSWALD:
We're not allowed to – it's in our contracts.

ZACH:
Is it?

OSWALD:
We're not allowed to say anything against the council, or they won't relocate us or we'll loose our redundancy. But other people can protest for us - I'm sure when word gets out, everyone will be very angry.

ZACH:
People are fighting their own battles.

ROSE:
They can't do that can they? Where will I go?

OSWALD:
I don't know.

LYNDSEY:
It's not just us, they're closing 4 libraries in the area, within one week.

ZACH:
They say there's no money left to pay for it all.

LYNDSEY:
Bastards.

ZACH:
Well, maybe there isn't.

ROSE:
So you've given up?

OSWALD:
There's nothing we can do.

ROSE:
But I haven't finished.

OSWALD:
I'm afraid we don't have a choice.

ZACH:
I've printed off that thing you asked for, Kubark. It's 82 pages.

ROSE:
Thank you.

ZACH:
So that's £4.10...

[Throughout this narration, ROSE is going through the box and getting her research in order ready for the end. Maybe spreading it out onto the floor, downstage.]

LYNDSEY:
In the last week before we closed, we almost forgot about Rose.

OSWALD:
We had other things on our minds. We had our instructions for closing down the library, and that's what we did.

LYNDSEY:
It all happened so fast we didn't have time to think.

ZACH:
Oswald secretly photocopied pamphlets for the local save the library campaign.

OSWALD:
My one act of resistance.

ZACH:
But as we were winding down, Rose was winding up. From the moment we gave her that photocopy she didn't stop; she still came in every day to continue her research with a new found energy, right until the final day, when she was the last person here.

ROSE:
I am even more connected to this than I thought. These techniques for torture are drawn directly from Dr Cameron's research. They are happening all over the world, and the roots go right back... Sebastian

.13. Torture

[Sound, white noise, lights off]

ROSE [voiceover]:
The arrest must achieve surprise and maximise mental discomfort to catch the suspect off-balance, ideally early morning.

[Sebastian is thrown on stage]

Remove the subject's own clothes. Familiar clothing reinforces identity and the capacity for resistance.
Sebastian's clothes are removed

First the senses are starved of any input - with hoods, earplugs, shackles, total isolation.

Bombard the body with overwhelming stimulation - strobe lights, loud music, beatings, electric shocks. Soften up the prisoner until they're too afraid to think rationally or protect their own interests.

[Music mix]

Take the suspect to the interrogation room.

[Picture of room]

The room should be free of all distractions - dull colours
A chair central

Don't have a telephone in the room. It's a visible link to the outside; its presence makes the subject feel less cut-off, better able to resist.

Look for an opportunity - an interval which may be extremely brief - of suspended animation, a kind of psychological shock or paralysis. At this moment the source is far more open to suggestion, far likelier to comply, than he was just before he experienced the shock.

It is in that state of shock that most prisoners give their interrogators what they want. They give up things they would otherwise fiercely protect.

ROSE:
Like Sebastian in the stadium.

[Flashback to Sebastian in the stadium in Chile. He is surrounded by guards, looking broken.]

SEBASTIAN:
Emilio Gonzalez, Moneda 1155 - Juan Perez, El Juncal 050 - Ferdinand Avila, Una `Norte 567 - Gustavo Navarro, San Martin 345

ROSE:
It's ok Sebastian. I know now. I know why they let you out of the stadium. You didn't have a choice. It's not your fault. You couldn't have done anything else.

SEBASTIAN:
But I did do something. I never told you - my one act of redemption. You know Victor Jara's last song, the one that he wrote in the stadium? Well I carried out the lyrics to that song on a scrap of paper in my shoe when I left. I was so terrified that they would search me and find it but I also felt that I had to try. It was my one act of moral courage. I smuggled out the words of his manifesto in my shoe and the tune in my head and the story in my heart. I never told anyone that because I couldn't ask for the glory without also admitting to the shame of giving up my friends.

ROSE:
It still wasn't your fault.

OSWALD:
Rose...

ROSE:
What happened to me, happened to you. It's a repeated pattern.

OSWALD:
Are you ok?

ROSE:
They tried to break us, but they didn't manage it.

LYNDSEY:
Rose, who are you talking to?

ROSE:
Sebastian.

ZACH:
Sebastian's not here - it's just me, Lyndsey and Oswald.

LYNDSEY:
And I'm afraid that's it. Time to lock up.

ROSE:
I understand now. It's all linked. Cameron's research - what happened to me - was used by the CIA to design a manual for torturing people - Kubark - which was used in Chile on Sebastian.

LYNDSEY:
We have to leave now

ROSE:
I was always directly connected to him, we just never knew how. Electric shocks, torture. It was just called different things. I was being 'treated' and Sebastian was being 'tortured', I was a patient and he was a suspect, but the techniques were the same. And it's not just us /either

OSWALD:
We can't do any more to help you Rose. You're going to have to find somewhere else to go. It's time for us to leave now – it's over.

ROSE:
No. This applies to you too.

First there is a shock. With me and Sebastian it was treatment or torture. But like with a person, why can't a coup, or a war, a natural disaster or a financial crash put an entire population into a state of shock? Shocked people are like children, vulnerable, looking for a parent figure to tell them what to do, and governments can exploit this. The Kubark manual says 'broken suspects are far likelier to comply than they were before they experienced the shock'. The same idea applies to society. 'Only a crisis - actual or perceived - produces real change'; that's what an economist called Milton Friedman said years ago. The crisis is the opportunity to make the world anew, to re-programme, to write over a blank slate.

OSWALD:
You're saying that whole countries are being brainwashed?

ROSE:
Kind of, I'm saying that powerful interests can use shock to try and change the world to their own advantage.

ZACH:
How?

ROSE:
When populations are in a state of shock - say like 9/11 - it becomes a sort of democracy-free zone. Things that would normally be opposed or scrutinised are just accepted because people are distracted, disorientated, confused or desperate. Leaders can say they are doing whatever is necessary to respond to the crisis. Just look at this country, look at what they are doing, look at what they have done to your library.

ZACH:
You think the closure of our library is like 9/11?

ROSE:
No, I'm talking about the principle - your shock was the financial crash.

LYNDSEY:
Do you really think that we're in a state of shock?
 
ROSE:
I think that you were, now I think you're just too dazed, or resigned or lazy to do anything about it. You need to work out how to become shock resistant. Sebastian said all those years ago, that if I could remember what happened to me then I would find peace. Well now I know the truth, but I haven't found peace – I've become shock resistant. I can choose my own way now, I can fight back. I know my story. And it's the same for you. If you're going to fight back, you need a story.

ZACH:
But what is that story?

ROSE:
You've got a whole library here, look for it yourself. Don't let the bastards grind you down.

ZACH:
That was the last time we saw Rose.

LYNDSEY:
After her outburst, we just stood here for a few minutes. Until we realised...she'd left all her research – her life's work.

NAOMI:
But she'd gone.

OSWALD:
We tried to find her, but we didn't have her address. She wasn't a member. She borrowed all her books on Zach's card.

ZACH:
I owe £24.50 in overdue fines.

OSWALD:
So we just left it here.

LYNDSEY:
And we all went home to continue the rest of our lives.

OSWALD:
And then yesterday we each received one of these letters – forwarded on to us from the council. Inside was a handwritten note. We weren't 100% sure who had sent it, but we had a suspicion.
Holds up a note scrawled with "Don't let the bastards grind you down" written on it.

LYNDSEY:
Rose told us, if you value your way of life, what you hold dear, you need a story to explain it. So we came back to find one...

ZACH:
Maybe it was Sebastian's story we were looking for.

NAOMI:
Or maybe it was Rose's.

LYNDSEY:
Or maybe it's every story that ever was, or will be, in this library.

OSWALD:
Whichever it is, we needed to tell it, for Rose's sake.

ZACH:
Because otherwise there might not be any more Roses - not because she might have died, or because people like her don't exist, but because even if she wanted to she couldn't come here anymore - Costa Coffee is moving in. She'd have to pay £2.10 for a latte to come in here. And it's unlikely they'd help her find books about torture.

LYNDSEY:
We've been sleeping through the destruction of something that matters. We've been told we're in the middle of a crisis so many times that we'd started to believe there was no alternative, that these cuts were necessary, that the closure of our library was inevitable. Well that's bollocks.

NAOMI: 
Until they install the banquettes and the condiment stations, this is still a place for ideas and thinking. It was free for Rose to come here, sit in warmth and find things out about the world - about herself. That's worth fighting for.

OSWALD:
Exactly. Our history, our collective memory, our dreams are still here, they aren't gone yet. And we must defend them, so that everyone, no matter who, can find their own answers.

ZACH:
What do we do now?

OSWALD:
All this belongs to us. It's ours. Are we just going to let it go? We know our story now – we're armed. I say we stay.

LYNDSEY:
I agree.

ZACH:
Me too.

NAOMI:
We're ready for them now...

[END]
